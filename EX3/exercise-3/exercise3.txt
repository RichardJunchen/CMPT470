---> Status code for the server's response.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status code 200

---> If-modified-since

If modified since includes HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
The main difference is the second request does not contain the information about Content-Type, Content-Style-Type, Content-Language.

---> Redirect

Got HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Compared with first request, it has fewer header. The redirect one contain a 'Location' title which indicates the location URL of new web page is. It has a different a Content-Type and Content-Length with the first one. 


Command-Line Requests

Using 'curl' and GET without any other instructions will only return the content of the page. (Document type is HTML)
-I in 'curl' will return the header info instead of the content of the page. Notice that adding the '/' at the end of URL or deleting the '/' at the end of URL will return the different state code. Since the second URL will redirect to the first web page, it will show the state code is moved permanently

--> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
http://www.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/470e3
--> HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

The same result will get in -esS with 'GET' in the situation of adding '/' or deleting '/'. The different between 'curl -I' and 'GET -esS' is the former returns only page header information, while the latter returns both header information and page content. 


Developer Tools

I promise I played with the developer tools.
